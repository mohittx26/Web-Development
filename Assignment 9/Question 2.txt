## Key Flexbox Properties:

Here's an explanation of the role played by the following key properties in the flexbox layout model:

**1. justify-content:**

* This property controls the **horizontal alignment** of flex items within the flex container.
* It accepts various values, including:
    * `flex-start`: Aligns items to the left edge of the container.
    * `flex-end`: Aligns items to the right edge of the container.
    * `center`: Centers items horizontally within the container.
    * `space-between`: Distributes items evenly with equal spacing between them.
    * `space-around`: Distributes items evenly with equal spacing around them.
* Choosing the right `justify-content` value helps you achieve the desired horizontal distribution of items within the container.

**2. align-items:**

* This property controls the **vertical alignment** of flex items within the flex container.
* It accepts various values, including:
    * `flex-start`: Aligns items to the top edge of the container.
    * `flex-end`: Aligns items to the bottom edge of the container.
    * `center`: Aligns items vertically centered within the container.
    * `baseline`: Aligns items by their baselines.
    * `stretch`: Stretches items to fill the height of the container.
* Selecting the appropriate `align-items` value ensures the desired vertical alignment of items within the container.

**3. gap:**

* This property defines the **spacing between flex items**.
* It can be specified as a single value to create equal spacing around all items, or as two values to define the horizontal and vertical spacing separately.
* Using the `gap` property ensures consistent spacing between items and prevents them from overlapping.

**4. flex-direction:**

* This property determines the **direction** in which the flex items are laid out.
* It accepts values such as:
    * `row` (default): Arranges items in a row from left to right.
    * `row-reverse`: Arranges items in a row from right to left.
    * `column`: Arranges items in a column from top to bottom.
    * `column-reverse`: Arranges items in a column from bottom to top.
* Setting the appropriate `flex-direction` dictates the overall layout of the flex container and its child elements.

**5. flex-wrap:**

* This property controls whether the flex items wrap onto **multiple lines** when the available space is insufficient.
* It accepts values such as:
    * `nowrap` (default): Prevents items from wrapping and overflows the container.
    * `wrap`: Allows items to wrap onto multiple lines.
    * `wrap-reverse`: Wraps items onto multiple lines starting from the end.
* Choosing the appropriate `flex-wrap` value ensures efficient use of space and prevents overflowing content within the flex container.
